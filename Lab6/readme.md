### Executive Summary 
In Lab 6 I will be Learning about ways my brower secures itself and also learn about methods to further increase the security of my browser. I will also be using HTML to make a webpage for the HTML and CSS part of the lab!

### Internet Architecture

##### Internet Protocol
An IP address is a bunch of numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. Computers use IP addresses to use these numbers to send data to a location. The ICANN allocates IP addresses into the five Regional Internete Registries around the world.

##### TCP/IP
TCP/IP is a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received though network adapters, hubs, switches, routers, and other network communications hardware. Its pupose is to connect government computer systems to each other through a global, fault, tolerant, network. The Client needs to know the IP Address of whatever Server it wants to connect to and it also needs to know the port number that it wants to send and receive data through after a connection has been established. 

Layers are important in changing technology because any of the layers/tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers. Some applications that run on the application layer would be: HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, and SMTP

##### Internet Security
HTTP supports the client server model by sending data from your computer accross a public internet to get to a webserver. Secure HTTP encrypts the data that is being retrieved by HTTP. This ensures all data over the internet is secured by using encryption algorithms.

##### Securing your Web Browser
Unsecure web browsing can cause spyware being installed on your computer. ActiveX is used in microsft internet explorer on Microsoft Windows systems ActiveX brings quality of life to the user but may also introduce severe vulnerabilities if not properly implemented.

### Internet Programming

##### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of The World Wide Web Consortium's mission is to bring diverse stake-holders together, under a clear and effective consensus-based process to develop high-quality standards based on contributions from the W3C Members, staff, and the community at large. The web design and applications standard is important because it sets the standard for building and rendering web pages that include, HTML, CSS , SVG,  AJAX, and many more. This standard is essential for all internet applications.

##### HTML5 and CSS
HTML editors are needed to create and modify web pages. HTML basic uses things like headings, Doctype, paragraphs, links, and images. I used all of these when I made my web page for this lab. HTML links allow users to click their war from page to page. I used an image link in my web page

##### HTML and XML
XML carries data, displays data, and XML has no predefined tags.

### Components of a URL
Scheme - This tells your browser what type of address it is so the browser connects to it correctly.
Domain- Domain is the most noticable part of a URL. It states the name that the website will be referred by
Top-level domain - Top-level domain may give you more general information on what kind of site it is.
Default page - A default page is loaded if you don't specify a path by only entering a domain name.
Parameters - Parameters give critical information to the server
Anchor - The anchor tells your browser to scroll to or load a specific part of the page.

### Conclusion
I have learned a lot about online security and I am now going to further increase my browsers security. I really enjoyed making my own Web page using HTML. However I did get really confused when doing the URLs and File Paths part of this Lab.
