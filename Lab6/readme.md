### Executive Summary 


### Internet Architecture

##### Internet Protocol
An IP address is a bunch of numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. Computers use IP addresses to use these numbers to send data to a location. The ICANN allocates IP addresses into the five Regional Internete Registries around the world.

##### TCP/IP
TCP/IP is a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received though network adapters, hubs, switches, routers, and other network communications hardware. Its pupose is to connect government computer systems to each other through a global, fault, tolerant, network. The Client needs to know the IP Address of whatever Server it wants to connect to and it also needs to know the port number that it wants to send and receive data through after a connection has been established. 

Layers are important in changing technology because any of the layers/tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers. Some applications that run on the application layer would be: HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, and SMTP

##### Internet Security
HTTP supports the client server model by sending data from your computer accross a public internet to get to a webserver. Secure HTTP encrypts the data that is being retrieved by HTTP. This ensures all data over the internet is secured by using encryption algorithms.
