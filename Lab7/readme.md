### Executive Summary 


### File Compression
Zipped files (compressed files) take up less storage and they can be transferred to other computers quicker than uncompressed files. The file size of my file uncompressed is 39.8 KB (40,813 bytes). After compression the file size is 25.5 KB (26,150 bytes). SVG is generally larger than a JPEG image of the same image.

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
The methods and of the shark class are def (define) and print. The constructor is used to initialize data. A class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class. While an object is an instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program.

If I am going through a McDonalds drive thru than the class would be McDonalds and the objects would be chicken nuggets, fries, and a drink. The object is sammy. The class is shark. The abstraction is swim(self). The inheritance is a specific type of shark. Finally the encapsulation is the definition of a shark.
